[Verse 1]
And it was all good just a week ago
Now I'm just somebody that you used to know
And what I know now is I can't sleep
'Cause I keep sending texts that you don't read
Tell me, what am I supposed to do?
When I see someone else is gettin' close to you
When I get jealous 'cause he starts posting you
And I'm stuck here, still not over you
Is it really truе that you're movin' on?
Everything's gray since you'vе been gone
Got a permanent rain cloud above my head
Sometimes I wonder if I'm ever gonna smile again

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
So please don't take my sunshine away

[Verse 2]
It's been three weeks and a couple days
You showed me it was over in a couple ways
I can smell you on a couple of my old clothes
We used to be a couple, now I'm so alone
I guess that's why you stopped sharing locations
I guess you're back out now, gettin' wasted
With somebody new in all the old places
Your side of my bed stays so vacant
And maybe one day I can let you go
You know the real me that nobody knows
Got a permanent rain cloud above my head
Sometimes I wonder if I'm ever gonna smile again
